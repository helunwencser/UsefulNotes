java is compile language, java source code is compile to bytecode by compile and interpreted by jvm at running time to machine code. So it can be both compiled and interpreted language. But here the iterpretation is different from intrepreting high-level language to machine code directly.

fragile base class problem: when an api's signature has changed to a new version, the jvm will check the new version and try to load the new version when running but not crash the program.It works with very late binding and dynamic loading with programmable class loaders.

Late binding: offset are not calculated until load time, field and method references represented symbolically in the bytecode.

Java environment:
	Java2SE: JRE, JDK
	Java2EE: Servlet Development Kit, EJB implementation

char 16 bit unicode not 8 bit

default values: 0 for basic types, null for others

string: str = "val" is stored in method area;
	str = new String("val"); is stored in the heap

add no arg constructor to initialize all properties.

private: useable in class
protected: usable in package or with inheritance
public: useable everywhere

printf available in System.out.printf with same format as in C.

composition - strong association
	    - weak associtation: passing an object by reference in a method

Object relationship:
	Encapsulation - making data in a class private
	Containment 
	Association
	Inheritance
	Polymorphism

Encapsulation:
	class level encapsulation
	component level encapsulation

package:
	floders created for grouping common classes
	protected - package level variables(accessible or usable in any class
within a package)

Exception Handling:
	Error: cannot recover from, program will crash.
	Exception: can recover
		know about the exceptions and can do something about it(checked)
			are subclasses of RuntimeException
			try/catch clause must be used
		new problems and do not know what to do(unchecked)
			are subclasses of Exception

Customer Exception:
	associated error number and error message is required

JNI:
	java native interface

Object Relationships:
	Encapsulation: private data members
	Association: passing an object by reference
	Containment: instantiating an object inside another class
	Inheritance: recycling the properties and methods from parent to child
	Polymorphism: single method

Inner class:
	Inner class is not recommended.
	Other classes can access inner class if it is defined as public.
	Inner class can access all properties of outer class directly. But
outer class cannot access properties of inner class directly even if it is
public. Outer class can only access properties of inner class throug an
instance of inner class even if properties are private.
	Type 1:
		An instance of outer class has to be created for creating an
instance of inner. Inner class code acts like an instance for code access
perspective. e.g.: Outer outer = new Outer(); Inner inncer = outer.new
Inner();
	Type 2:
		Local inner class(side a method). Can only be abstract or
final, on other modifiers are allowed. No static variables are allowed.
	Type 3: 
		Using an class with word static in front of it. e.g.: Inner inner = new Outer.Inner();
	Type 4:
		Anonmymous inner class. One time inner class.

Lists:
	search: sequential or binary search(sorted)
Hashing:
	Set: unique list of values(unique value is stored in a key), indexing information
	Map: unique list of sets
Tree:
	sorted structure
	Red Black Tree

Collections:
	List: ArrayList and LinkedList

	Set: HashSet(unsorted) and TreeSet(sorted)

	Map: HashMap(unsorted) and TreeMap(sorted)

	LinkedHashSet: LinkedList and HashSet

	LinkedHashMap: LinkedList and HashMap

JVM, SystemThreadGroup Library:
	Thread is instantiated, pass a reference to the os.
	Process: instructions, memory, state of registers and pc.
	Memory: cs, ds, stack and heap.
	State of process or context: memory, register and value of pc.
	Context switching: refers to one processor switching from one process to another.


Non-preemptive: once CPU gives attention to the process, it must complete the allocated block of time.
Pre-emptive: If CPU has given attention to the process, it doesn't have to complete the allocated block of time, if the next process of higher priority comes into picture.

The JVM and Packages are thread safe and re-entrant.

run() is called by operating system.

Create a thread:
	extends Thread: thread.start().
	implements Runnable: thread.start().

Set priority of thread in java:
	.setPriority(Thread.NORM_PRIORITY).

Enable communication between threads:
	wait(), notify(), notifyAll(), create dependency between threads so a thread can complete a task and another thread can start.
	join(), enable wait in one thread while other threads finish.

Thread communication with synchronization - share resources and locking.

isAlive(): if thread is alive

Socket:
	IP Address + port number
	(Machine + Process) --> Socket(associtate streams)

java.net Package
	Inetaddress:
		wrapper around IP address - v4, v6, and v8 addresses.
		cannot write IP address to a machine.
		can read a value only.
	ServerSocket:
		creating a multithreaded server.
	Socket:
		client
	URL:
		emulating a client to WS(browser)

Sockets:
	public Socket(InetAddress address, int port);
	public Socket(InetAddress address, int port, InetAddress localAddr, int localPort);
	public Socket(String host, int port);
	publci Socket(String host, int port, InetAddress localAddr, int localPort);

Socket Options:
	SO_LINGER:
		send large chunks of data and force the connection to maintain.
	SO_TIMEOUT:
		how long should the socket remain live when there is no activity.
	TCP_NODELAY:
		setting a small delay for small packet.
		Nagles Algorith:
			setting windowsize number
			when sending a lot of packets, limit the window size
			client transmitting:
				transmit 10(each one is labeled) 1 of 10, 2 of 10 etc.
			server receiving:
				arrive in any random order
				length of time server should wait for client to retransmit.
			receiving [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10]: send request to retransmit missing packets 2, 4, 6 before collating next window.

ServerSockets:
	public ServerSocket(int port);
	public ServerSocket(int port, int backlog);
		backlog: the number of requests that can stay in the queue for the server to response to.
	public ServerSocket(int port, int backlog, InetAddress binAddr);
		binAddr: which ip address to use for the socket, because a server may have multiple ip addresses.

Multithreading implementation:
	Create a server:
		a.extending Thread in ServerSocket
		b.extending Thread in Socket object returned by accept() method(recommended).

TCP relability:
	During the transmission of packets using TCP connection, if the packet loss over a connection passes some limit or the network connecting a pair of communicating processes is servered or becomes serverely congested, the TCP software responsible for sending messages will receive no acknowledgement and after a time will declare the connection to be broken. Thus TCP does not provide reliable communication, because it does not guarantee to deliver messages in the face of all possible difficulties.

Java UDP API:
	DatagramSocket, DatagramPacket

Referential Integrity.

Primary key: ensure each row has a unique value.
Foreign key: referencing a primary in another table.

Normalization: minimize redundant and inconsistent data and avoid update anomlies.

Rules of normalization:
	1. no repeating fields.
	2. create a primary key and use this for referring to data in other tables.
	3. no interdependency between columns.

IS NULL operator
= NULL will not work for null cells.
|| string concatenate operator:
	select ename || ', ' || empno "Emp Name, ID"
	from emp
	where sal > 4000;
% is used for matching all characters, _ is used for matching one character.
ESCAPE option:
	select dname
	from dept
	where dname like '%\_%' escape '\';
	here \ is used as escape character, we can choose any character as the escape character.
